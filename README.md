# StreamSeeker

StreamSeeker is a web-app that allows you to search for a movie or TV show and get links for where you can stream it. 

If you sign up as a user, you can also save your search results to come back to later. 

Streamseekers saves you the time and effort of searching each of your streaming services looking for your movie or show. 

## Technologies used:

- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Testing with Cypress 
- TMDB api
- Movie of the Night api 

## Quickstart

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js]

   ```
   nvm install 18
   ```

### Run this project locally

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename your fork to `StreamSeeker-<your fork name>`
3. Clone your fork to your local machine
4. Install Node.js dependencies for both the `frontend` and `api` directories.
   ```
   ; cd api
   ; npm install
   ; cd ../frontend
   ; npm install
   ```

5. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [`linter-eslint`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom.

6. Install MongoDB
   ```
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@5.0
   ```
   *Note:* If you see a message that says `If you need to have mongodb-community@5.0 first in your PATH, run:`, follow the instruction. Restart your terminal after this.
   
7. Start MongoDB
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@5.0
   ```

### How to run the server and use the app (as a human)

1. Start the server application (in the `api` directory)

  **Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

   ```
   ; cd api
   ; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm start
   ```
2. Start the front end application (in the `frontend` directory)

  In a new terminal session...

  ```
  ; cd frontend
  ; npm start
  ```

You should now be able to open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/signup` to create a new user.

Then, after signing up, you should be able to log in by going to `http://localhost:3000/login`.

After logging in, you won't see much but you can create posts using PostMan and they should then show up in the browser if you refresh the page.

### How to run automated tests

The automated tests run by sending actual HTTP requests to the API. Therefore, before anything, you'll need to start the backend server in test mode (so that it connects to the test DB).

**Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the api directory
; cd api

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run start:test
```

You should leave this running in a terminal.

Then, you can either run tests for the backend or the frontend following the steps below. 

#### Running tests for the backend

Run the tests in a new terminal session:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the api directory
; cd api

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run test
```

####  Running tests for the frontend

Start the front end in a new terminal session

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
; cd frontend

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm start
```

Then run the tests in a new terminal session

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
; cd frontend

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run test
```

## MongoDB Connection Errors?

Some people occasionally experience MongoDB connection errors when running the tests or trying to use the application. Here are some tips which might help resolve such issues.

- Check that MongoDB is installed using `mongo --version`
- Check that it's running using `brew services list`
